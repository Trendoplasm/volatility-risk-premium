"""Numeric comparison of two output directories.

Reproducing this study bit-for-bit is not achievable, and not a meaningful goal: the ordinary
least-squares routines underneath depend on the host's linear-algebra library, so identical code
on two machines can disagree in the last floating-point digit. Observed drift between macOS and
Linux is on the order of 1e-13 relative.

Two values are therefore treated as agreeing when

.. code-block:: text

    |a - b| <= atol + rtol * max(|a|, |b|)

which is the combined absolute-and-relative test :func:`numpy.isclose` uses. Both halves are
needed. A purely relative test cannot work here, because several exported columns are the
*residual of an identity* whose correct value is zero: ``attribution_error`` reports how far the
Greek decomposition missed the realised profit, and a correct run puts it at 1e-14. Comparing
1e-14 against 0.0 relatively gives a difference of 100%, so a relative-only check calls a
perfectly reproduced study a failure. The absolute floor is what makes those columns comparable,
and it sits many orders of magnitude below the smallest quantity the study reports.
